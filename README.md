# Bible-Book-Retriever
This project will retrieve a book of the Bible, in the translation you desire, from the internet, then store locally in a word document. If desired, it can parse out the verses.

- Runs: 
   * A run in a word document is a continuous sequence of words having similar properties, such as similar font sizes, font shapes, and font styles.
   * Can use Runs once I've set the highlight color of words in the Word Doc. Highlighted words will be a Run and non-highlighted Runs will be another Run.

- Headers
   * Info on creating Headers. Could be useful for setting each Chapter # as a Header, to provide an Outline to easily navigate the document with.


# Committing 
- Using Git Bash
   * Using Git Bash, set user.name and user.email to your profile
   * In Git Bash push commits up (git push origin main)
   * Git Bash prompted me for credentials, opted for signing-in online (not the token option), authorized a Git Credential Manager, was prompted to enter password, was authorized
      * Token option was not approved

- Set user.name and user.email per Repo
